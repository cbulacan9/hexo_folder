What influenced and inspired me to learn code?

My whole life I was inspired by science and technology, it was what drove me to pursue engineering in college.
However, after finishing college in mechanical engineering, I felt that I did not really connect with that discipline. 
I figured that I would take some time to do some self reflection and really analyze what I wanted to do with my life. 
In the time after college I decided to work on my self and expand my knowledge. The job that I found allowed me a lot 
of time freedom to pursue hobbies and work on my social skills. In this time I worked on side projects with my father, 
as an accountant he has many interesting clients who I had the opportunity to network with. There was one project in 
particular which really helped me see potential. I worked to help set up an apparel start-up. At first I was only 
supposed to be assisting as a support role, but quickly my responsibilities grew. It was during this time that I was 
really able to see how difficult it is to bring an operation from starting to sustaining, it is no easy feat. It also
opened my eyes to see the flaws and inefficienies of the company that I was currently working for my day job. It was 
at this point that I could see the usefulness of technology, especially those web-based. I was able to think of some 
tools which I could potentially develop to help employees of these small businesses and startups succeed. The reason I 
want to pursue coding, is so that I could help these businesses succeed and assist in bringing new tools and services
to small operations. I feel that it would be great to be a creator, someone who could make people's lives much easier. 
I would love to help small businesses succeed and help other's build their dreams.
